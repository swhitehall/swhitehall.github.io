Having grown up in Barbados, tropical weather has always been a part of my life. In recognition of the
vulnerability of Small Island Developing States to the effects of weather and climatic hazards,
enhancing resilience and promoting sustainable development in the Caribbean region is at the forefront of my research.
My main research efforts include the study of tropical cyclogenesis particularly
the role of air - sea interactions in the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- The Effect of the Upper Ocean on Tropical Cyclone Intensification in the eastern Caribbean
- Modelling Ocean Heat Content and Salinity across the eastern Caribbean
